        <h2>Learn About Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>On this page, you will learn about key areas of online safety, including strong passwords, phishing awareness, privacy management, social media safety, and device security.</p>

    <!-- Passwords Section -->
    <section id="password-section">
        <h2>Passwords</h2>
        <p>Passwords are your first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts. A strong password makes it much harder for attackers to gain access. It is recommended to use a mixture of <strong>lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols</strong>. This increases the number of possible combinations, making it exponentially more difficult for a hacker to guess your password.</p>
        <p>For example, a password with only lowercase letters might have 26 possible characters for each position. Adding uppercase letters doubles that to 52, adding numbers increases it to 62, and adding symbols can push it to over 90 characters per position. The more combinations there are, the longer it would take for someone to brute-force your password.</p>
        <p>Tips for creating strong passwords:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use at least 12 characters.</li>
            <li>Include a combination of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>
            <li>Avoid dictionary words or personal information such as names or birthdays.</li>
            <li>Use a password manager to generate and securely store complex passwords.</li>
        </ul>
